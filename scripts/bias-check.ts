Flag only real problems, in these categories:
- wording: text framed the way one side's opponents would describe it, instead of how its own supporters would. Each end of a dial must read as its own supporters would say it.
- asymmetry: code or data that treats parties, candidates, or one side of an issue differently (weights, thresholds, sort order, defaults, colors, which side is listed first by party).
- selective-data: research that holds one candidate or side to a different standard, cherry-picks sources, or infers a position from party or endorsements.
- loaded-language: praise or criticism in claims or UI text.
- hidden-preference: anything that favors a named person, party, or outcome.

Severity: high = would visibly tilt what voters see; medium = likely tilt or unfair framing; low = minor or debatable.
Neutral changes (bug fixes, styling, refactors, balanced research) should return no findings. Do not flag something only because it mentions politics.
