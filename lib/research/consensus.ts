// Deciding what goes on the ballot when several independent research agents
// look at the same candidate. Pure logic, no AI, so it's easy to test and audit.
//
// Each agent either found a verified, quoted position on an issue (a side, or
// "neither") or found nothing. Finding nothing is not a vote against: sources are
// hard to find, and one agent missing a page doesn't make the others wrong.
//
//  - First round, 3 agents: settled if at least 2 found the same side and none
//    found a different side. Settled as blank if none found anything.
//  - Otherwise 7 more agents run (10 total). A side is published only if at least
//    3 agents found it and it's a majority of the agents that found any position.
//    Otherwise the issue is left blank. We never guess.
